        <h2>History</h2>

        <p>The origin of the cookie dates back to the 17th century, when British cooks would test oven temperatures by baking a small piece of cake batter, which resulted in a delicious little biscuit. The word “cookie” comes from the Dutch word “koekje,” meaning “little cake.” Although it has European roots, the cookie as we know it today was perfected in the United States, thanks to American Ruth Graves Wakefield. In the 1930s, she created the famous chocolate chip cookie recipe at her inn in Massachusetts.</p>
