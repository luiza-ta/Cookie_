        <br>

         <input type="checkbox" name=" 1¼ cups all-purpose flour "

        <br>

         <input type="checkbox" name=" 1 teaspoon baking powder "
        > 1 teaspoon baking powder

        <br>

         <input type="checkbox" name=" ½ teaspoon baking soda "
        > ½ teaspoon baking soda

        <br>

         <input type="checkbox" name=" 1 pinch of salt "
        > 1 pinch of salt

         <input type="checkbox" name=" 1 large egg "
        > 1 large egg

      </ul>

      <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>

      <ol>

        <li>In a bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a small bowl, crack the egg and set aside.</li>

        <li>Place the cold, cubed butter in a stand mixer and beat with the paddle attachment for about 20 seconds just to soften it slightly.</li>

        <li>Add both sugars and beat for another 30 seconds until it forms a moist, crumbly mixture. Add the chocolate chips and mix briefly just to combine.</li>

        <li>Add the flour mixture and beat for a few seconds until it resembles a dry crumb. Then add the egg and beat for about 1 minute, just until the dough is fully combined and no dry flour remains. Don’t overmix — you want to avoid developing too much gluten, which would make the cookies dense.</li>

        <li>To shape the cookies: measure ¼ cup of dough per cookie. Press and level it in the measuring cup for consistency. Roll into balls with your hands and flatten slightly into disks about 2¾ inches (7 cm) in diameter. Place on a large baking sheet, leaving about ¾ inch (2 cm) between each.</li>

        <li>Freeze the baking sheet with the cookie dough for at least 1½ hours. This helps create cookies that are crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.</li>

        <li>About 30 minutes before baking, preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C).</li>

        <li>Bake for about 15 minutes. The cookies will puff up and turn lightly golden at the edges but stay soft in the center — they’ll crisp up as they cool.</li>

        <li>Remove from the oven and let them sit for 15 minutes before eating. This resting time ensures the perfect texture: crispy edges and a gooey center.</li>

      </ol>
